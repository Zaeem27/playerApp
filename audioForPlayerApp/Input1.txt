
Adventure on the High 
Seas
Narrator Z
Welcome! Today we set out on the high seas with Captain A, First Mate B, and 
their  crew. I’m  skipper  Z  and  I’ll  be  here  during  the  journey  to  describe 
everything. I’m just joining the crew today as well, so I’ll be learning along with 
you here. Let’s meet the Captain A and the First Mate B.

Captain A
Ahoy skipper Z! I’m Captain A. I’m excited for some new crew members for this 
journey. We hope to find a magnificent treasure at the end of it! Has First Mate 
B introduced himself?

<!checkpoint!< First Mate B
Not yet, Captain A!I’m First Mate B, first in command to Captain A. 
We’re setting off on our journey now, so do you understand our names?
<!repeat!<

Alright, then we’re off!

Skipper Z
Wow, the air feels so soft and cool, I can smell the salt! Do you hear that
music? <sfx dwdw.wav< Hold on, what’s that sound, down in the water? <sfx dwdw.wav<

MerKing E
Hello, sailors! I am the MerKing E, lord of the seven seas! This is my right hand 
man, Merman K. We come to you with a request.

Merman K
You see, MerKing E’s daughter, the Mermaid P, has been captured by an evil 
pirate crew, and we need your help to get her back. Whaddya say?

<!checkpoint!< First Mate B
Well, let’s get to it. We will need to fight them using what we know now of the 
Braille alphabet. So, how do you feel about our names up to now? There’s A, B, 
E, K, and P. Got it? <!repeat!<

Merman K
Thank you, kind pirates! Set sail for the evil pirates, and rescue the Mermaid P!

Skipper Z
Off we go, then! The sails have been lowered <sfx dwdw.wav< and the ship’s started to skip 
over the waves <sfx dwdw.wav< !
